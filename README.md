# Twitter Cyberbullying Detection Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting cyberbullying on Twitter, particularly targeting ethnicity and religion-based bullying. It involves analyzing a dataset of 24,000 tweets, balanced across different cyberbullying categories.

## Methodology
- **Data Collection:** Tweets collected from Twitter during the COVID-19 pandemic.
- **Data Processing:** Cleaning techniques include removing stopwords, mentions, URLs, emojis, punctuations, tokenization, and lemmatization.
- **Feature Extraction:** Utilizing Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF.
- **Classifiers Used:** Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost).
- **Performance Metrics:** Accuracy and F1 Score.

## Libraries Used
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, nltk, sklearn, xgboost

## Setup and Execution
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required Python libraries.
3. Run the Python scripts to train and evaluate the models.

## Results
- The project compares the performance of different classifiers using BoW and TF-IDF features.
- XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy and F1 Score.
